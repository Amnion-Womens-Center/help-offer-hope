        You can support Amnion and support life by being well-informed about the services we offer so you can encourage
        potential clients to come to our center. Most people know we are here for those women and men facing an
        unplanned pregnancy. We offer free pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, biblical counsel, and helpful resources.
      </p>
      <p class='paragraph mb-5'>
        Did you know we also offer help for those dealing with an abortion decision in their past? Our post-abortion
        healing can help set people free from the shame and guilt.

        <li>Make sure your Pastor and Youth Pastor are aware of Amnion and our free and confidential services.</li>
        <li>Be a cheerleader in your congregation by promoting our events.</li>
        <li>Bottles for Life is an easy way to promote Amnion and help support our mission. Learn more.</li>
        <li>
          Amnion is on the front lines of evangelism. We look to refer women and men to local churches for ongoing care
          and discipleship. Check out the Making Life Disciples program.

        For 30 years Amnion has been faithfully supported by a wonderful group of donors who love life! Perhaps you have
        family or friends who are champions for the unborn and are looking for a life-affirming ministry to support.
        Help us get the next generation of supporters on board by encouraging your kids, grandkids, and nieces and
        nephews to pray for and donate to Amnion or their own local pro-life pregnancy center.
