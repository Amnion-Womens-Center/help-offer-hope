        Protecting human life involves an intense and escalating spiritual battle. Pray that the women and men facing
        unplanned pregnancies will find their way to our center, especially those considering abortion. Pray for us to
        have compassion and wisdom. Continually pray for Amnion’s clients, staff, and volunteers.

        One way to help raise money for Amnion is to give us your cans, electrical cords, aluminum, copper, laptops, and
        Christmas lights. Our Coordinator, Dave Bergstedt, will pick it up from Amnion and exchange it all for cash.
        Since Dave started this project, he’s raised over $38,000 for Amnion! Call 952-898-4350 for details.
